# Programs from CSC-201

Welcome to the **Programs-from-CSC-201** repository! This collection features a variety of Python programs developed during my **Data Structures** course (CSC-201). The projects demonstrate the practical use of various data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## üìö Course Overview

CSC-201 focuses on the study of core **data structures** and their applications. Topics covered include:

- **Linked Lists**: Implementations and usage in data manipulation.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Managing data in a LIFO/FIFO manner.
- **Trees & Binary Search Trees**: Hierarchical data structures for efficient searching and sorting.
- **Hash Tables**: Storing and retrieving data efficiently.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Exploring different algorithms and their time complexities.
- **Big O Notation**: Analyzing the performance of algorithms and optimizing solutions.

This coursework has allowed me to strengthen my understanding of how data structures impact the efficiency of algorithms and how to optimize code performance.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following key files and programs:

- **Program 1: Random Writer**: A program that generates random text based on a given book.
- **Program 2: Mazes**: Solves mazes using different search algorithms.
- **Program 3: Palindrome Checker**: A program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Program 4: List Reverse**: Reverses a list of items using different methods.
- **Program 5: Zombie Contact Tracing**: Implements a contact tracing system for a zombie outbreak scenario.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Skills

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- **Python Programming**: Core language used for development.
